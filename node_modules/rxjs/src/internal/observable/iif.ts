/**
 * Decides at subscription time which Observable ***REMOVED***actually be subscribed.
 *
 * <span class="informal">`If` statement for Observables.</span>
 *
 * `iif` accepts a condition function and two Observables. When
 * an Observable returned by the operator is subscribed, condition function ***REMOVED***be called.
 * Based on what boolean it returns at that moment, consumer ***REMOVED***subscribe either to
 * the first Observable (if condition was true) or to the second (if condition was false). Condition
 * function may also not return anything - in that case condition ***REMOVED***be evaluated as false and
 * second Observable ***REMOVED***be subscribed.
 *
 * Note that Observables for both cases (true and false) are optional. If condition points to an Observable that
 * was left undefined, resulting stream ***REMOVED***simply complete immediately. That allows you to, rather
 * than controlling which Observable ***REMOVED***be subscribed, decide at runtime if consumer should have access
 * to given Observable or not.
 *
 * If you have more complex logic that requires decision between more than two Observables, {@link defer}
 * ***REMOVED***probably be a better choice. Actually `iif` can be easily implemented with {@link defer}
 * and exists only for convenience and readability reasons.
 *
 *
 * ## Examples
 * ### Change at runtime which Observable ***REMOVED***be subscribed
 * ```ts
 * import { iif, of } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * let subscribeToFirst;
 * const firstOrSecond = iif(
 *   () => subscribeToFirst,
 *   of('first'),
 *   of('second'),
 * );
 *
 * subscribeToFirst = true;
 * firstOrSecond.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // "first"
 *
 * subscribeToFirst = false;
 * firstOrSecond.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // "second"
 *
 * ```
 *
 * ### Control an access to an Observable
 * ```ts
 * let accessGranted;
 * const observableIfYouHaveAccess = iif(
 *   () => accessGranted,
 *   of('It seems you have an access...'), // Note that only one Observable is passed to the operator.
 * );
 *
 * accessGranted = true;
 * observableIfYouHaveAccess.subscribe(
 *   value => console.log(value),
 *   err => {},
 *   () => console.log('The end'),
 * );
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // "It seems you have an access..."
 * // "The end"
 *
 * accessGranted = false;
 * observableIfYouHaveAccess.subscribe(
 *   value => console.log(value),
 *   err => {},
 *   () => console.log('The end'),
 * );
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // "The end"
 * ```
